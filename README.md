Medical Checkup is a backend App connected to the Africa's Talking USSD system (Simulation mode).

It uses the USSD simulator to perform the medical chack up.

A person is given a USSD code and get a bunch of questions related to a particular disease. In this scenario, we are checking for ebola.

We have just simulated different questions to signify Ebola disease once all the tests are true.
