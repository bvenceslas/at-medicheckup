# at-medicheckup

**at-medicheckup** is a medical check up API that utilizes the Africa's Talking USSD API(Simulation mode) to allow users to check up for the signs the feel wether they correspond to the disease of EBOLA.

We have just simulated some few signs about EBOLA in order to apply USSD notions to the API we were building.

### Scenario

As users might be aware of the USSD code to check for ebola, they just need to compose the given USSD code, and respond to the survey questions that will prompted to him.

### Note

Even though all of this is done on the **Sandbox simulator** of Africa's Talking API, It is a practical guide on how we can use the Africa's Talking USSD API
